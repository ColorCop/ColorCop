-------------- What's new in v5.4 --------------

* Magnify while eyedropping

  This option is on by default and allows the user to see a magnified area
  while eyedropping. The pixel that is being selected will appear in the
  magnifier window with a black square around it.

* Use Cross Hair cursor

  the standard windows cross hair cursor can be used in lieu of the
  eyedropper to select colors.

* Relative position measurements

  If you press the Control key while eyedropping the coordinates will be set
  to zero (0,0). When you drag the mouse to a new location the coordinates
  values will be relative to the point where you pressed control. This is
  very useful if you want to measure how pixels a certain object is. Note
  that if you get a reading of 8,8 the area you just measured
  is really 9,9 because the zero row and column are included.

* Detect WebSafe color

  With this option enabled, color cop will indicate if the color selected
  by the eyedropper is WebSafe or not.

* Allow Multiple Instances

  This is an option which allows the user to restrict only one instance
  of color cop from running at once, or allow multiple copies to run.

  Some designers are forced to use the 216 color websafe palette. When this
  options is enabled, only websafe colors can be selected. If a color is
  selected and it is not websafe, it will be converted to the nearest
  websafe color. Websafe colors have RGB decimal values which are multiples
  of 51 or zero.(0, 51, 102, 153, 204, and 255)

*** Color Cop FAQ ***

  - How are these HTML RGB Hexadecimal Triplets used?

    Here is an HTML example.  The other programming hex codes should
    speak for themselves.

    <html><title>This is a sample</title>
    <body bgcolor="#ffffff">This makes the background color WHITE.
    <font color="#ffff00">This is YELLOW text.</font>
    <table width="100%" bgcolor="#0000ff">
    <tr>
    <td>This Background is Blue!!</td>
    </tr></table>
    </body></html>
